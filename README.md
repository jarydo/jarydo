### Hi there 👋

My name is Jaryd and I am a first-year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo! I'm a continuous learner and problem solver who isn't afraid to step up to a challenge! Here are some fun facts about me:

- 🎥 I'm passionate about movies and have directed 2 short films (one of which won Best Picture at my high school film festival), along with writing articles for my high school newspaper and have written a review professionally for a small movie
- 🎵 I love to listen to music and play Tenor Saxophone and Piano (and am currently learning guitar)
- ⛷️ I enjoy skiing
